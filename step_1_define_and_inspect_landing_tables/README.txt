In this step, I used the Glue console to create three Glue tables:  customer_landing, step_trainer_landing, and accelerometer_landing.

Each of these is reading the raw json in the respective locations within the bucket.

Even though I used the Glue console to create the tables, Athena lets me query to show how the table was created in SQL.
I have included the DDL SQL statements, and screenshots from Athena for various queries of each landing table.
